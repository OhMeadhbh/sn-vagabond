<p>
  This app could not have been made without some
  exceptional open source packages. It would be gauche (and
  a violation of some licenses) if we didn't alert the world
  to their awesomeness.
</p>

<p>
  For rendering and displaying web pages, we use jQuery,
  Backbone.js, Bootstrap and Handlebars.js.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> is an extremely
  popular tool for (among other things) manipulating elements on
  a web page and enabling cross-browser XHR support. It is released
  under a dual MIT / GPL license. jQuery uses the
  <a href="http://sizzlejs.com/">Sizzle selector engine</a> internally
  which is released under MIT, BSD and GPL licenses.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a>
  is a MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework for JavaScript
  applications. Backbone is copyrighted by Jeremy Ashkenas and
  DocumentCloud but released under <a href="https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/blob/master/LICENSE">a MIT license</a>. Backbone.js is
  mature, functional, well-documents and it's easy to find
  examples of its use.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
  forms the core of our CSS styling and many user elements. It is
  <a href="https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/blob/master/LICENSE">released
    under an Apache License</a> and is awesome.
</p>

<p>
  We use a templating library from Yehuda Katz called
  <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars.JS</a>. Think of it
  as "<a href="http://mustache.github.com/">Mustache</a> on
  steroids," and you wouldn't be far off. 
  <a href="https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/blob/master/LICENSE">Handlebars</a>
  is released under an MIT license.
</p>

<p>
  On the server side we use <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>
  as a framework for our application logic. We use the popular
  <a href="http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/">Connect</a>
  package to manage routing HTTP requests within our app.
</p>

<p>
  This interface was made with <a href="http://smithee-us.github.io/larb.html">larb</a>, a collection of
  useful scripts, HTML fragments and node weirdness for configuring
  headless linux computers. It also is released with a MIT License, so feel free to use it!
</p>

<p>
  We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the individuals
  responsible for these packages. Track us down sometime, we'll
  buy you a beer.
